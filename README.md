The Fjelstul World Cup Database is a comprehensive database about the FIFA World Cup created by Joshua C. Fjelstul, Ph.D. that covers all `21` World Cup tournaments (1930-2018). An update with data on the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be available soon. The database includes `27` datasets (approximately 1.1 million data points) that cover all aspects of the World Cup.

[**JaseZiv/worldfootballR**](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR)

This package is designed to allow users to extract various world
football results and player statistics from the following popular
football (soccer) data sites:

- FBref
- [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/)
- [Understat](https://understat.com/)
- [Fotmob](https://www.fotmob.com/)

Since the release of `v0.5.3`, the library now supports very rapid
loading of pre-collected data through the use of `load_` functions.

The data available for loading is stored in the `worldfootballR_data`
repository. The repo can be found
[here](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR_data).

this project aims for three things:

1. Acquire data from transfermarkt website using the [trasfermarkt-scraper](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-scraper).
2. Build a **clean, public football (soccer) dataset** using data in 1.
3. Automatate 1 and 2 to **keep these assets up to date** and publicly available on some well-known data catalogs.

## Football Culture & Fan Experiences

_The heart and soul of English football below the professional tiers — community, tradition, and authentic matchday culture at the National League and below._

### Introduction: Why Non-League Match Days Matter

The **National League** (5th tier of English football) and the wider non-league pyramid (Steps 1–7+, 800+ clubs) represent the heart of grassroots football in England. With ticket prices of £5–£15 compared to £30–£70+ in the top tier, non-league football offers an authentic, accessible, and community-driven alternative that has been revitalising local communities since the 1979 Football Conference era.

> "The atmosphere at my local non-league ground is the best I've experienced in English football — at any level. The fans are passionate, the players are accessible, and the whole thing feels real." — *Reddit, r/NationalLeague*
>
> "I pay £8 to stand pitchside at a club where the chairman waves to me from the dugout. In the Premier League, I'd pay £60 for a seat behind the goal and never know the players existed." — *NonLeagueMatters forum*

For a deeper exploration of non-league matchday traditions — 17 key traditions, cost analysis, community discussion sources, and recommended reading — see the companion document **[NON-LEAGUE-MATCHDAY-CULTURE.md](NON-LEAGUE-MATCHDAY-CULTURE.md)**.

### Key Traditions at a Glance

2. **Intimate Grounds** — Small terraces putting supporters pitchside for spontaneous chants and every tackle

4. **Local Rivalries** — Geographically close clubs producing passionate, community-rooted derbies
5. **Family Inclusion** — Children on the pitch at half-time, free or cheap admission for all ages
6. **The Conference Legacy** — The 1979–2004 Football Conference era of independence and self-governance
7. **Chants & Songs** — Organic, locally-written songs reflecting community identity
8. **The Clubhouse** — Pre-match social clubs where fans and officials mingle freely
9. **Pie, Mash & Gravy** — The iconic non-league culinary tradition and "Footy Scran" movement
10. **The Physical Programme** — A collectible souvenir supporting club finances
11. **Freedom of the Terrace** — No assigned seats; move freely to follow your team
12. **Non-League Day** — Annual awareness event during international breaks
13. **Post-Match Socialising** — The pub after the match as the ritual continues
14. **Supporter Trusts** — Fan ownership and governance models across the pyramid
15. **Travel & Away Culture** — Dedicated followers travelling to away matches
16. **Ground Improvement** — Fans volunteering weekends to repaint, re-turf, and improve facilities

Non-league football has seen a significant **attendance boom** in recent years, with COVID-19 accelerating a trend of fans seeking more authentic, community-focused football experiences.

### Modern Digital Integration

Despite the old-school atmosphere, non-league fans are increasingly tech-savvy:
- Checking live stats on phones during matches
- Following "as it stands" league tables at half-time
- Blending grassroots tradition with podcasts, social media, and live-tweeting
- Using apps like TheFans.io to track grounds and plan away days
